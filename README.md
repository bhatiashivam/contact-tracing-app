# Cryptographic Contact Tracing Smartphone Application
### Developed UI of the application using Figma
- The is designed to use cryptographic key scheduling for a new 
privacy-preserving Bluetooth protocol to support Contact Tracing. Contact Tracing makes it possible to 
combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus by alerting participants of possible exposure to someone 
who they have recently been in contact with, and who has subsequently been positively diagnosed as 
having the virus. This specification complements the Bluetooth specification that contains further 
information about the scheduling of the advertisements and the higher-level lifecycle of the protocol.
